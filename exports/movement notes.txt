NOTES FOR TILESTARS
(should try to study other games movement instead of just rivals

can have run-stop animation, but its completely cancelable

interestringly, instead of starting from 0, then incrementing to 7 (by something like .3 for example), roa goes straight to 7 after jumpstart


air_fric = .02
air_accel = .3

holding forward adds air acceleration (air_accel) first, then applies air friction (air_accel - air_fric = .28). only applies if hsp < max airspeed

jump_change = 3

jump_change adds hsp once jumpstart ends
